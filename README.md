The difference between Redis SET operation is because RDB doesnâ€™t impact the performance of the server.
Since the main process only has to fork its process and the child process will take care of all the writing on the disk,
the performance of the parent process is preserved.

Because AOF, Redis will log every write operation received by the
server so that AOF can not be very performant depending on the fsync setting.
